WordPress is convenient, as much as I hate to admit it, it is. Iâ€™m not using WordPress as my primary website because it is loaded with way moreÂ stuff thenÂ youâ€™d probably everÂ need to use. To be fair, it needs to cater to as many use cases as possible (hence a CMS).

However, if all you need is to writeÂ a bunch of articles and you intend to code up your own website, then [WordPress.comâ€™s API](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/console/) might just be your answerâ€¦

I write these articles on [WordPress.com](http://WordPress.com) and use [GraphQL to query](https://jasonnathan.wordpress.com/work/graphql) the endpoints. I wire up the everything using `react-apollo`, add some styles and, well here we are. (You are reading this on my website arenâ€™t you?)

I wish I found time to clean every thing up and publish little packages for you guys to use :(
