So, you've decided to host your own website or service, and naturally, you check out local hosting providers. Then you see the prices. And promptly spill your coffee.

I get it. Hosting in Singapore is expensive. It's not just the hosting itself (our own **.sg** and **.com.sg** domain prices start at **$50 and up**!) and thatâ€™s before you even get into storage, bandwidth or any of the extras. Compared to hosting options available internationally, it just feels like we're being taken for a ride.

But donâ€™t worry. Iâ€™ve done the legwork, and hereâ€™s a guide to cheap (and sometimes free) hosting solutions that will save you from paying a fortune while still getting a decent setup. I've tried to ensure that I only list the stuff I think will last, but as you know these things change rapidly. So they might be relevant now, but you'd need to revisit this in future.

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Alright, letâ€™s start with the big guns.

[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) offers a **free tier**, which is arguably one of the best deals around if you know what youâ€™re doing. The catch?

> *You need to be tech-savvy.*

Setting up an EC2 instance and managing your own infrastructure isnâ€™t exactly beginner-friendly, and Amazonâ€™s pricing structure can be daunting. But if youâ€™re willing to roll up your sleeves, AWS provides free-tier usage for **12 months**, including:

* **750 hours/month** of a t2.micro instance (enough to run a basic site 24/7).
    
* **5GB of free storage on Amazon S3** (perfect for storing website assets).
    
* **1 million API calls per month** via AWS Lambda (serverless functions!).
    

Will AWS always offer this free tier? Who knows. But by the time they pull the plug, letâ€™s just assume your site is already making millions and you wonâ€™t mind the extra cost. *(Thatâ€™s how it works, right?)*

If the setup sounds intimidating, Fiverr is your friend. There are plenty of **freelancers offering AWS setup for $5**, just make sure to read the reviews before handing over your credentials.

## DigitalOcean â€“ The $5 Powerhouse

If AWS is too complicated, [DigitalOcean (DO)](https://www.digitalocean.com/) **is a fantastic alternative**. While not free, their starter plan is **just $5 per month**, and that gets you:

* **1 CPU core**
    
* **512MB RAM**
    
* **20GB SSD storage**
    
* **1TB bandwidth**
    

For that price, you'll find exactly 0 local providers that would offer hosting.

Iâ€™ve personally used DO for projects at Heardable, running high-performance applications that scaled effortlessly. You get full control over your server, predictable pricing, and a community packed with tutorials to help you set things up.

Need more power? Unlike AWS, scaling up is straightforward. You wonâ€™t have to play guessing games with complex pricing tables.

## What About Domains?

Both AWS and DigitalOcean **do not sell domains**. But thatâ€™s not an issue because you can buy your domain from any provider and point it to your server. Personally, I use [DynaDot](https://dynadot.com) (reliable, reasonable prices), but [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com) frequently runs insane promos where you can grab a **.com for $1.99**.

Just avoid getting roped into unnecessary upsells, GoDaddy loves pushing premium add-ons *that you donâ€™t need*!

## Managing Your Domain. Cloudflare to the Rescue

Setting up your domain isnâ€™t just about buying one; youâ€™ll need to manage DNS settings, ensure security, and optimise performance. For that, [Cloudflare is a no-brainer.](https://www.cloudflare.com/)

Cloudflare is completely free and gives you:

* **DNS management** (super fast and easy to use).
    
* **DDoS protection** (helps keep your site from getting taken down by malicious attacks).
    
* **CDN caching** (loads your website faster for visitors around the world).
    
* **Free SSL certificates** (because having a padlock in the address bar is important these days).
    

Whether you host on AWS, DigitalOcean, or anywhere else, using Cloudflare is one of the best things you can do for your site.

## Are There Other Free or Cheap Hosting Options?

Yes. Plenty.

There are shared hosting providers offering low-cost solutions, but they often come with caveatsâ€”limited storage, forced ads, or questionable reliability. Still, if youâ€™re running a simple personal blog or a portfolio site, they might be worth considering. Here are I've found:

* **000WebHost** (free but with forced branding and limited uptime).
    
* [**ByetHost**](https://byet.host/) (free, but you get what you pay for).
    
* **InfinityFree** (another free shared hosting option).
    

However, if youâ€™re serious about uptime and performance, Iâ€™d stick to DigitalOcean or AWS Free Tier.

## Final Thoughts

Hosting in Singapore is expensive, but thankfully, youâ€™re not limited to local options. With AWS (if you're tech-savvy), DigitalOcean (for the best bang-for-buck VPS hosting), and Cloudflare (for domain management and security), you can host a professional website for free (or nearly free) without compromising on quality.

While things change fast in tech, these providers have been solid in 2016 and should continue to be reliable for the foreseeable future.

Need help setting things up? Fiverr might be worth a look.

And if you ever find cheaper, better hosting in Singapore, do let me know... because until then, Iâ€™m keeping my money where the value is.

## Bonus: Quick Comparison

| Provider | Cost | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AWS Free Tier** | Free (for 12 months) | Extremely powerful, full control | Complicated setup, pricing after 12 months |
| **DigitalOcean** | $5/month | Easy setup, predictable pricing, scalable | Not free, self-managed VPS |
| **Cloudflare** | Free | DNS, security, CDN, free SSL | No actual hosting (just management) |
| **000WebHost** | Free | Completely free hosting | Ads, downtime, unreliable |
| **ByetHost** | Free | No forced ads | Limited resources, slow |
| **GoDaddy Domains** | $1.99+ | Frequent promotions | Expensive renewals, upsells |

Yep! So there's your cheat sheet to cheap (or free) web hosting. Hope this saves you some money!
