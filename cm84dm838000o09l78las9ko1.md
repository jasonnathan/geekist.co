I've met with many people who have an idea for a startup but have very little information about what to do next. If you haven't acquired funding, then a MVP will definitely help but even if you have, this next bit is still very relevant.

This list is sorted in an order that many people seem to think in. They ask questions starting on the top first and eventually dig deeper as they move along. I chose to use the same order so it may be easier to understand why something is important.

### 1\. Decide which platform(s) you need to support.

If you're targeting mobile devices, you can't stop at deciding which OS (Android, iOS) etc. You willÂ also need to decide which version(s) of the OS to support. Older versions generally have more bugs, older hardware and lack many features. If you have the expertise to do it, then follow the trend ofÂ *current + last two versions*. For example:

* Android 7 (6 & 5)
    
* iOS 10 (9 & 8)
    

While we're on mobile apps, there'sÂ a common sentiment in the industry aboutÂ [hybridÂ vs.Â native](https://www.jasonnathan.com/articles/startups/hybrid-vs-native-the-age-old-debate-revisited)Â apps whereÂ the former is less performant & easier to develop than the latter. With the popularity of Facebook's React & React Native,Â a native app is marginally more work that a hybrid app. Also, modern browsers, techniques and packages can make a hybrid application's performance difference somewhat negligible and fairly unnoticeable depending on your product.

Choose based on your budget and resources available to you. If you have access to a webÂ based developer, chances are he'd have little troubleÂ moving into hybrid development

It doesn't get easier if you've got a browser (or web) application. Not only are there more browsers than there are mobile operating systems, there are also different versions of the same browser per OS. Have a look at [CanIUse](http://caniuse.com/#comparison) to have an idea. Again, if you can, the trend is also *current + last 2 version*

Do you really need to support all these versions?

### 2\. Know your target audience.

Ever wonder why it is one of the very first questions a potential investor will ask you? It isn't only because they want to know how much money your idea can generate but also to calculate how much it will cost to develop your idea.

It is important to find out who your **first** customers will be. The number of these people depends on your application. If it's a B2B offering, chances are you'd need to know who your first 10-100 customers are.

If it's a trendy B2C offering, you'd be looking at your first 200-500 customers. Think about who they'd be, what they are like and how they would best use your product.

The demographics ofÂ *first*Â customers will greatly help in deciding.

### 3\. Identify your core feature (and strip everything else out).

A lot of startups begin with one idea that quickly turns into twenty different features, mostly out of fear that the product wonâ€™t feel "complete" enough. This is a common mistake.

Your MVP should focus strictly on your core, killer feature - the single, unique thing that solves your customer's primary problem. Anything beyond that should go onto your "future ideas" list. Keep it lean at first because this saves your budget, development time, and sanity.

Did I mention time and money? **I cannot stress this enough!**

Besides, extra features might confuse your initial audience or, worse yet, distract you from delivering something genuinely valuable. Remember, it's far better to do one thing brilliantly than ten things mediocrely.

### 4\. Sketch, prototype, and validate quickly.

Before you spend weeks or months coding, grab pen and paper or any rapid prototyping tool like *InVision*, [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) (pick your favourite poison) and sketch out exactly how your app should work. Donâ€™t get fancy; stick-figure sketches are perfectly fine.

Now, put these sketches in front of your potential customers. Remember the ones you identified in step 2?

> *Get brutally honest feedback.*

The quicker you validate your assumptions, the less likely youâ€™ll waste valuable resources building the wrong thing. This rapid-feedback loop will save you from painful pivots down the line.

Remember: prototypes aren't about *perfection*, they're about *clarity* and *validation*.

### 5\. Decide how youâ€™ll build it (your tech stack).

By now, you've figured out your platform, audience, and core functionality. Next up: deciding exactly what technologies you'll use. Your choice of tech stack can impact everything from initial development speed, scalability, ongoing costs, and even hiring down the line.

Choosing your tech stack depends largely on your existing team or access to talent. Some of the most flexible and widely used options today include [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for backend development (ideal for rapid development and scalability), [React](https://react.dev/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/) for frontend web applications, and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) or [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) / [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) for mobile apps.

Avoid falling into the latest-trend trap. Evaluate your choices based on maintainability, hiring potential, community support, and available resources.

Seriously, youâ€™ll thank yourself later!

And there you have it: 5 critical steps to bring clarity to your MVP journey. While every startupâ€™s path is unique, following this approach can help you avoid common pitfalls and ensure you're building something your customers actually need.

Remember, at this stage, agility is everything. Keep listening to your users, refine your idea quickly, and don't hesitate to pivot if your data points in a new direction. With focus, feedback, and a bit of grit, you're already ahead of most.

Good luck! And happy building!
