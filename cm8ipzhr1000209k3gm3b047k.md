In the twilight of Keto Lent’s strict decree,  
milk of the oat forbidden as flavours flee,

There dwelled a woman of discipline and quiet rebellion.  
The unshaken skeptic of the *Milk Substitute Deception*.

She had known many a milk that was but false,  
yet endured countless cups of coffee pours.

**✨ *The Quest of the Cream***

Upon the break of every dawn, a ritual quite the same.  
A cup. A pause. A plea. Another cry in vain.

This time….

> “Baby,” she whispered, voice like almond silk,  
> “If we can use two spoons of almond milk… can we not *try* oat instead?”

And there he stood, Her Dravidian Knight.  
Battle-scarred from kitchen war, with a tummy bulge - a show of might

He looks into her eyes, he pauses,

> he stares

he leans forward and says in but two words

> “**Fruck Yes!**”

And so the maiden spoke, the silence broke,  
and thus; this Croffee quest awoke

**✨ *The Making of the Cream***

15 mils of heavy cream, [like before](https://geekist.co/croffee-anyone-or-kroffee-if-youre-so-inclined), his quest begins  
30 mils of some oat gleam - sweet, but without the sin.  
Treacherous is the alchemy that births milk worthy of a Queen!

A milk forbidden by the lords of macro law  
But creamier and tastier than common lore

Yet hidden in this balanced substance -  
’tis lighter on sin than a nun’s conscience.

**✨ *The Moral of the Cream***

This was never just about coffee.  
It was love. It was flavour.  
It was the holy refusal to sip what tasted of water.

The first taster.  
The voice. The spark.  
She whose plea did not just cream the cup -  
It crowned her, unseen, unshaken:  
**First Lady of the Creamed Order.**

And her Knight, he rides no longer for glory,  
but for flavour.  
For fat.  
For Keto.  
**For a story.**
