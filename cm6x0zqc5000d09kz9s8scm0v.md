Imagine watching a video where every transition, every slide, every moment feels *effortless*. The visuals glide smoothly, perfectly timed to the rhythm of the music.

In [*How to Stay on Beat and Out of Bars (Musically Speaking)*](https://geekist.co/how-to-stay-on-beat-and-out-of-bars-musically-speaking), I explored why bars and time signatures matter in music. But what if I told you that *knowing your bars* also makes you better at video editing?

Sure, visuals are everything in a video but nothing screams professionalism like how well it syncs to the music, or the rhythm - and that led to a video that garnered over [1.5k views on Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thegeekist/video/7455196169564622087?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7465721843812894226)!

### The Psychology of Synchronization

If you’ve ever watched a slideshow where slides seem to change at random, or a reel where the music *almost* syncs but is just a fraction off, you know the feeling, it’s like an itch you can’t scratch. This isn’t just an aesthetic issue. Studies on audiovisual synchrony show that well-timed transitions **increase engagement and perceived quality**.

That’s because our brains naturally seek patterns, a concept explained by [Gestalt psychology's principles of grouping and continuity](https://www.verywellmind.com/gestalt-laws-of-perceptual-organization-2795835).

When you watch a presentation-style video that’s *out of sync*, you either:  
1️⃣ Power through because the content is *just* interesting enough to override the mild irritation...  
2️⃣ Or - let’s be real - you nope out *immediately* because something *deeply* offends your brain’s sense of order.

> If you’ve ever felt personally attacked by bad timing, congratulations! You’ve just experienced a **"geek breakdown"** - which totally means you’re exactly where you belong.

> Welcome to *this* blog. We get you.

### Case Study: My 1.5k views TikTok Experiment

That’s exactly what we wanted to avoid in our own content experiments at Geekist. So, when my partner suggested a short-form video to illustrate [Latin prefixes](https://geekist.co/how-to-geek-out-over-latin-without-sounding-like-a-priest), we knew we had to get the rhythm right. She suggested that we found visuals relating to a small set of prefixes and that we create slides to define each prefix.

Brilliant! I thought. Here’s the result:

<iframe src="https://www.tiktok.com/player/v1/7455196169564622087?controls=0&progress_bar=1&play_button=1&description=1&rel=0&music_info=1&closed_caption=0" style="width:100%;height:630px;border:0;border-radius:4px;overflow:hidden" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts">
</iframe>

#### What’s happening there?

* Each slide is exactly 4 seconds long and lasts 16 bars total (2 bars each slide)
    
* Notice the “beat drops” exactly when the slide with man playing percussions comes in? Did you feel the progression?
    
* The last slide, the “outro”, happens when the 16 bars complete and ends gracefully with a message to visit Geekist.co for more information.
    

#### The Planning Phase

I decided on **8 slides + 1 outro** so the video wouldn’t feel too draggy. At first, I tried **3 seconds per slide** (a total of **27 seconds**), but it felt rushed. So I bumped it up to **4 seconds per slide**, making the video **36 seconds long**.

But how in the world do you calculate the **BPM (beats per minute)** of the song to use?

Fret not, my fellow geeks, for here’s a nifty calculator just for you:

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/z7vg9j?view=preview&amp;module=%2Fsrc%2Findex.html&amp;hidenavigation=1" style="width:100%;height:480px;border:0;border-radius:4px;overflow:hidden" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"></iframe>

> For example, if you want a **40-second** video with **10 slides**, you’d need **4 seconds per slide**. That means a BPM of **120** (where every 4 seconds = 2 bars) would fit perfectly. Try adjusting the numbers in the calculator above to see what works for you.

The min and max BPM in the form help keep the music *somewhat* relatable to a general audience. That said, if you’re determined to sync your slides to an *aggressive Dubstep drop*, go for it - just don’t blame me when your viewers start glitching in real life.

And the rest is easy. If you landed on **120 BPM** like I did for my video, that’s the *Goldilocks zone* of tempos, and there’s an *endless* supply of tracks in that range. Seriously, if you can’t find a song at 120 BPM, you’re probably browsing in silent mode!

### How to Apply This to Your Own Videos

1. **Define Your Pace**: How long should your slides be? Create one slide and measure the time it takes. Try to use whole numbers - *3.5 seconds will be a nightmare to use!*
    
2. **Calculate the BPM**: Use the form above to figure out the BPM of the song you need. Faster BPMs are better for more intense presentations *(e.g., action montages)* and slower BPMs are more reflective *(e.g., emotional narratives)*.
    
3. **Map your visuals to the Beat**: Every 1 or 2 bars should be a new slide. Your outro can be 1 bar (or maybe even half a bar) to avoid an abrupt stop.
    
4. **Choose your background music**: You can make a track (like I did in FL Studio) or choose a song from the list of services below.
    

### Why All of This Matters

Timed transitions in PowerPoint/Keynote business presentations can [keep audiences engaged](https://varioproductions.com/2023/04/20/how-to-use-audio-and-visuals-to-enhance-your-presentation/).

For corporate videos, syncing animations and cutaways with music makes them look polished. Short form videos like in social media reels or Youtube Shorts benefit from seamless pacing too as it keeps viewers watching longer.

And hey, even musicians and dancers rely on these very same principles to synchronize stage visuals with music, so you're in good company.

Below, you'll find a short list of apps and sites that will help you in your music search.
