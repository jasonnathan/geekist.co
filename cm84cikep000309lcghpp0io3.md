Everyone seems to be talking about remote work these days, but let‚Äôs be honest, most employers still don't fully grasp what it genuinely involves. Sure, they might claim they're open to the idea, but once you start digging, you'd often find that their version of remote work barely scratches the surface. Many still cling to traditional management styles, believing that simply providing the option to work from home is enough to foster productivity and engagement.

As a result, there's a real risk you might feel lonely and unsupported, causing burnout and lower job satisfaction.

Kinda defeats the the whole point doesn't it?

### The Employer's Perspective on Remote Work

For some, remote work merely means allowing employees to occasionally work from home, perhaps when they're mildly ill but still capable of productivity. Others view it as an earned privilege, reserved exclusively for long-standing employees or those transitioning into regional roles. Surprisingly, many employers still can't fathom the idea of an employee working remotely from an entirely different country, unless it involves outsourcing. Clearly, despite the popularity of the term, misconceptions about remote work aren't going anywhere - but you can help!

### What Remote Work Actually Means

If you‚Äôre working remotely, you‚Äôre **not** on a casual arrangement. You‚Äôre just as responsible as your in-office colleagues - perhaps even more so. Here‚Äôs what remote work really looks like:

**Show up. On time. Every time.**

No one should feel like you‚Äôre ‚Äúout of the loop‚Äù just because you‚Äôre not physically in the office. If you work across time zones, sync your availability with your team and compromise where needed.

**Stay connected.**

If Slack (or a similar tool) isn‚Äôt in place, **suggest it** and encourage usage. Make sure there‚Äôs always an easy way for your boss and team to reach you.

**Help provide the tools your company needs.**

A good video conferencing tool is **non-negotiable**. (If you‚Äôre still dealing with clunky Skype calls, push for an upgrade.) Depending on your work, tools like TeamViewer or remote desktop solutions might also be essential.

**Respect working hours but be flexible.**

If your team is in another timezone, make an effort to match their core hours for collaboration. Otherwise, work within your own time zone while ensuring maximum overlap with key team members.

**Eliminate doubts about your commitment.**

Be the **first** to show up on calls. Attend all communal activities remotely if possible. Over-communicate if necessary (visibility matters!).

### Don‚Äôt Be Discouraged by Uninformed Employers

The truth is, many companies still don‚Äôt fully grasp the idea of remote work. It‚Äôs not yet mainstream (hopefully, we‚Äôll get there soon), but in the meantime, ask the right questions during interviews.

Don‚Äôt just ask: **‚ÄúAre you guys okay with remote work?‚Äù** That‚Äôs too easy to say yes to. Instead, ask: **‚ÄúHow does remote work function in your company?‚Äù** and dig deeper.

* Are there established workflows?
    
* Are remote workers part of daily meetings?
    
* Do they have remote leadership, or is everyone in charge still in an office?
    
* What‚Äôs their policy on promotions for remote employees?
    

These answers will tell you whether remote work is just a checkbox on a job listing or an actual part of the company‚Äôs culture.

### Tools for a Smooth Remote Work Experience

### The Future of Remote Work

We‚Äôre not quite there yet but remote work **is** gaining ground. Hopefully, in a few years, it won‚Äôt just be something companies claim to offer but that it would be a real, viable option for most jobs. Until then, keep pushing for it, set the standard for professionalism and prove that remote work isn‚Äôt about convenience but that it's very much about productivity and results.

Good luck! May we all work remotely one day. :)
